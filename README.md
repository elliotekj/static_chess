# Static Chess

**https://chess.elliotekj.com**

Inspired by [@maxmcd](https://github.com/maxmcd)'s [Static
Chess](https://www.val.town/v/maxm/staticChess), `static_chess.exs` is a single
file Elixir script that runs a zero-bloat chess server. Every page is plain html
and css, and every move is made by clicking a link.

## Local

To run this locally, clone the repo then:

```bash
$ elixir static_chess.exs
```
